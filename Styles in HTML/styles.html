            Never leave yourself so defenceless in front of an enemy! Stop bowing so pitufully! If that had worked your family would still be alive! How can a weakling like you, who bows down when it's time to fight [...] -cure his little sister, or even find his enemy? If you want something, you must fight for it! The meek have no power and no options! The strong will crush them in every way!
